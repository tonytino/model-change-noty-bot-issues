# model-change-noty-bot-issues
A place for the model-change-noty-bot to create issues.

This repo is simply for demonstrating the issue creation capabilities of my [Model Change Notification Bot](https://github.com/marqeta/model-change-noty-bot). This is because the bot is currently only able to create issues on repos I own (for simplicity).
